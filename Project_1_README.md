The overall purpose of this project was to get familiar with GitHub repositories and to outline our work on Cloud Security and the ELK Stack so that we can present this to future employers.

Within this repository we have:

- Linux Scripts
- Cloud Architecture Diagrams
- Ansible Configuration Files
- README markdown file explaining the ELK Stack Project
